# Brightness Test Scene - Test 2
# Translated sphere with sideways lighting (lighting computed after translation)

# Ambient lighting - low to see the effect of spot light
A   0.1   255,255,255

# Camera - positioned to view translated sphere
C   0,0,15   0,0,0.5   70

# Spot light positioned to the RIGHT of camera, lighting sphere sideways
# Light at (8, 0, 12) - to the right of camera position
# This creates sideways lighting on the translated sphere
L   8,0,12   0.9   255,255,255

# Translated sphere at position (5, 0, 0) - white/gray for better lighting visibility
# The halo/lighting should be computed at this translated position
# Should show clear sideways lighting: bright on right side, darker on left
