# Brightness Test Scene - Test 1
# Sphere at origin with sideways lighting

# Ambient lighting - low to see the effect of spot light
A   0.1   255,255,255

# Camera - positioned to view sphere along z-axis
C   0,0,15   0,0,-1   70

# Spot light positioned to the LEFT of camera, lighting sphere sideways
# Light at (-8, 0, 12) - to the left of camera, closer to sphere
# This creates clear sideways lighting effect
L   -8,0,12   0.9   255,255,255

# Sphere at origin {0, 0, 0} - white/gray for better lighting visibility
# Should show clear sideways lighting: bright on left side, gradually darker on right
