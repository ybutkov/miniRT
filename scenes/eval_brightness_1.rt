# Brightness Test Scene 1/2
# Tests: sideways lighting on sphere at origin and translated sphere

# Ambient lighting - low to see the effect of spot light
A   0.1   255,255,255

# Camera - positioned to view spheres along z-axis
C   0,0,20   0,0,0.5   70

# TEST 1: Spot light positioned to the left of camera, lighting sphere sideways
# Light at (-10, 0, 18) - to the left of camera, slightly forward
# This creates sideways lighting on the sphere at origin
L   -10,0,18   0.8   255,0,0

# TEST 1: Sphere at origin {0, 0, 0} - red color
# Should show clear sideways lighting with bright side on left, dark side on right
sp  0,0,0   3   255,100,100

# TEST 2: Translated sphere - positioned at (8, 0, 0)
# Same lighting setup, sphere should be properly illuminated after translation
# The halo/lighting should be computed on the translated position
sp  8,0,0   3   100,255,100

# Additional light for TEST 2 sphere - positioned to its right for sideways effect
L   15,0,18   0.7   0,0,255
