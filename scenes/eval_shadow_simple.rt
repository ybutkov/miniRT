# Ambient lighting - low to see shadows clearly
A   0.2   255,255,255

# Camera positioned aside to view sphere, plane, and shadow
# Positioned at angle to see both objects and shadow
C   -10,8,10   0,0,1   70

# Vertical spot light above sphere
# Positioned at (0, 15, 0) - directly above the scene
# This creates a clear shadow of the sphere on the plane below
