# Translations and Rotations Test Scene
# Tests: sphere translation and cylinder rotation

# Ambient lighting
A   0.2   255,255,255

# Camera - positioned to view the objects along z-axis
C   0,0,25   0,0,0.5   70

# Light source - positioned to illuminate the scene
L   10,10,20   0.8   255,255,255

# TEST 1: Two spheres - one at origin, one translated along z-axis
# First sphere at origin - red color
sp  0,0,0   3   255,100,100

# Second sphere translated 8 units toward camera (parallel to camera direction)
# Translation: moved along positive z-axis (toward camera)
# Distance > diameter (3*2 = 6), using 8 units - green color
sp  0,0,8   3   100,255,100

# TEST 2: Cylinder with 90° rotation along z-axis
# Original orientation: extending along y-axis (0,1,0)
# After 90° rotation around z-axis: orientation becomes (1,0,0) - extends along x-axis
# Positioned to the side for better visibility - blue color
